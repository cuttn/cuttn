# Hi, I'm Curtis !!

I'm a **second-year Computer Science student** at the **University of Western Ontario**, passionate about building things. Iâ€™ve been coding since I was young, and I love grinding relentlessly towards a goal.

## ðŸ”§ What I Do

Iâ€™m constantly exploring **cutting-edge technologies** and entrepreneurial projects, combining my academic knowledge with hands-on experience. Currently, Iâ€™m building a **Houseparty Marketplace App** targeting university students across North America, just trying to move fast and break things!

My expertise spans:

- **Backend Development & APIs:** FastAPI, Django, REST, JWT authentication, database modeling (SQL/Postgres), async programming, OOP, third-party API integration
- **Frontend / Mobile:** SwiftUI, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, integration with backend systems (I can fix cors!)  
- **Automation & Data Engineering:** Web scraping (Selenium, BeautifulSoup), asynchronous pipelines, workflow automation  
- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Docker, Firebase, deployment planning, containerized environments
- **Programming Languages:** Python (primary), Java, C++, C#, TypeScript  
- **Software Architecture:** API planning with Postman, async task orchestration, modular design, scalable system 

I thrive in environments where I can **bridge backend and frontend**, plan out robust APIs, and implement systems efficiently â€” Iâ€™ve built pipelines that scale, async workers that perform, and prototypes that demonstrate strong architectural thinking.

## âš¡ Strengths

- Full-stack development and system integration  
- Advanced problem solving & algorithm design (LeetCode!!)  
- Rapid prototyping and clean code practices
- Database modeling, API security, and modern authentication flows  
- Learning quickly and implementing new technologies into projects

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning & Exploring

- Full-stack mobile-first applications with SwiftUI + FastAPI  
- AI-assisted automation and data-driven applications  
- Optimizing async Python pipelines for real-world systems
